    "## Car accident chi-square test for independence\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "150 students from the University of Washington were shown a one minute clip of a car accident. After the students watched the clip, they were separated into three groups. Group 1 was asked how fast the cars were going when they hit each other. Group 2 was asked how fast the cars were going when they smashed into each other. Group 3 was asked nothing about the speed of the cars. After one week all students were asked whether they saw any broken glass. There were no broken glass in the film, but 7 out of 50 students reported seeing broken glass in group 1, 16 out of 50 students saw broken glass in group 2, and 6 out of 50 in group 3.     \n",
    "\n",
    "Our null hypothesis is that students' response for whether or not they saw broken glass in independent of the wording used in the question."
