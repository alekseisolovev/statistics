    "#Socioeconomic status and health\n",
    "##Overview\n",
    "Socioeconomic status is both a strong predictor of health, and a key factor underlying health inequities across populations. Poor socioeconomic status has the capacity to profoundly limit the capabilities of an individual or population, manifesting itself through deficiencies in both financial and social capital. It is clear how a lack of financial capital can compromise the capacity to maintain good health. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the socioeconomic factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities in health and access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that these racially centered disparities continue to exist and are a significant social health issue. The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences in the quality of care based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race. The Journal of the American Medical Association identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care, with ethnic minority groups receiving less intensive and lower quality care.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, sexuality has become a major source of discrimination and inequity in health. Homosexual, bisexual, and transgender populations experience a wide range of health problems related to their sexuality and gender identity. One of the egregious inequities that faces LGBT individuals is discrimination from healthcare workers or institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, in the United States, women have better access to healthcare than many other places in the world, in part because they have higher rates of health insurance. This trend in women reporting higher rates of insurance coverage is not unique to this population and is representative of the general population of the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment that surrounds us can influence individual behaviors and lead to poor health choices and therefore outcomes. Minority populations have increased exposure to environmental hazards that include lack of neighborhood resources, structural and community factors as well as residential segregation that result in a cycle of disease and stress. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, reasons for disparities in access to health care are many, but can include the following: lack of universal health care or health insurance coverage, lack of a regular source of care, lack of financial resources, legal and structural barriers. Multitude of strategies for achieving health equity and reducing disparities can be found in different scholarly texts.  \n",

    "The data set that will be used for this assignment is the U.S. National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). This survey is designed to determine the magnitude of alcohol use and psychiatric disorders in the U.S. population. It is a representative sample of the non-institutionalized population 18 years and older.\n",
